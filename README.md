# Sperm Motility Calculator using Visem Dataset

## Overview
This project aims to develop a sperm motility calculator using the Visem dataset. The Visem dataset contains information on sperm motility parameters collected from various studies. By utilizing this dataset, we can create a tool to estimate sperm motility and assess male fertility.

## Dataset
The Visem dataset is a comprehensive collection of sperm motility data from diverse sources. It includes parameters such as sperm count, motility rate, and morphology. This data serves as the foundation for our calculator, allowing us to analyze and predict sperm motility based on various factors.
